This allows even non-developers or business users to become software creators.\nAutoCRUD works by connecting to any relational database and transforming them into a smart spreadsheet interface! This allows you to build no-code applications collaboratively with teams. AutoCRUD currently works with MySQL, PostgreSQL \u0026 SQLite (only in Open Source) databases.\nAlso, AutoCRUD‚Äôs app store allows you to build business workflows on views with combination of Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord, Twilio, Whatsapp, Email \u0026 any 3rd party APIs too. Plus AutoCRUD provides programmatic access to APIs so that you can build integrations with Zapier / Integromat and custom applications too.\nFeatures Rich Spreadsheet Interface ‚ö° Basic Operations: Create, Read, Update and Delete on Tables, Fields, and Records ‚ö° Fields Operations: Sort, Filter, Hide / Un-hide Fields ‚ö° Multiple Views Types: Grid (By default), Gallery, Form View and Kanban View ‚ö° View Permissions Types: Collaborative Views \u0026 Locked Views ‚ö° Share Bases / Views: either Public or Private (with Password Protected) ‚ö° Variant Cell Types: ID, Links, Lookup, Rollup, SingleLineText, Attachment, Currency, Formula and etc ‚ö° Access Control with Roles : Fine-grained Access Control at different levels ‚ö° and more ‚Ä¶ App Store for Workflow Automations We provide different integrations in three main categories. See App Store for details.\n‚ö° Chat : Slack, Discord, Mattermost, and etc ‚ö° Email : AWS SES, SMTP, MailerSend, and etc ‚ö° Storage : AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Minio, and etc Programmatic Access We provide the following ways to let users invoke actions in a programmatic way. You can use a token (either JWT or Social Auth) to sign your requests for authorization to AutoCRUD.\n‚ö° REST APIs ‚ö° AutoCRUD SDK ‚ö° SQL Access : Run SQL queries on your data source from AutoCRUD UI itself (Coming soon!) Sync Schema We allow you to sync schema changes if you have made changes outside AutoCRUD GUI. However, it has to be noted then you will have to bring your own schema migrations for moving from environment to others. See Sync Schema for details.\nAudit We are keeping all the user operation logs under one place. See Audit for details.\nWhy are we building this? Most internet businesses equip themselves with either spreadsheet or a database to solve their business needs. Spreadsheets are used by a Billion+ humans collaboratively every single day. However, we are way off working at similar speeds on databases which are way more powerful tools when it comes to computing. Attempts to solve this with SaaS offerings has meant horrible access controls, vendor lockin, data lockin, abrupt price changes \u0026 most importantly a glass ceiling on what‚Äôs possible in the future.\nOur Mission Our mission is to provide the most powerful no-code interface for databases which is Open Source to every single internet business in the world. This would not only democratise access to a powerful computing tool but also bring forth a billion+ people who will have radical tinkering-and-building abilities on internet.\nHow can I contribute to AutoCRUD‚Äôs development ?
