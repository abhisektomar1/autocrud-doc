# Monitoring and Managing Flows

Once you've built and deployed your workflows, it's essential to monitor their performance and manage them effectively. AutoCRUD provides comprehensive tools to help you keep your workflows running smoothly.

## Flow Overview Dashboard

The Flows Overview page provides a centralized view of all your workflows:

- See all flows in your workspace
- View node counts for each flow
- Check schedule configurations
- Monitor execution status
- Access creation and modification dates

## Execution Monitoring

### Real-time Execution Tracking

Monitor your flow executions in real-time:

1. Click on a flow to open it
2. Navigate to the "Executions" tab
3. See active and completed executions
4. View detailed execution information

<!-- ![Executions Tab](/images/executions-tab.png) -->

### Execution Details

For each execution, you can view:

- Start and end times
- Duration
- Status (Success, Failed, Running)
- Input and output data for each node
- Error messages if applicable

Click on any execution record to see the full details, including the execution path and node-by-node results.

## Performance Metrics

AutoCRUD tracks key performance metrics for your flows:

- **Execution Count**: Number of times a flow has run
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful executions
- **Average Duration**: Typical execution time
- **Error Frequency**: Rate of errors by type
- **Resource Usage**: Computational resources consumed

Use these metrics to identify bottlenecks, optimize performance, and ensure reliability.

## Managing Workflows

### Activating and Deactivating Flows

Control when your flows are active:

1. Navigate to the Flows Overview page
2. Find the flow you want to manage
3. Use the toggle switch to activate or deactivate
4. Deactivated flows won't run automatically but can still be triggered manually

### Version Control

Keep track of changes to your workflows:

- Each saved change creates a new version
- View the version history of any flow
- Compare different versions
- Revert to previous versions if needed

### Duplicating Flows

Create copies of existing flows:

1. Open the flow you want to duplicate
2. Click the "Duplicate" option from the menu
3. Give the new flow a unique name
4. Modify as needed for your new use case

### Exporting and Importing

Share workflows between workspaces:

- Export flows as JSON files
- Import flows from JSON format
- Clone workflows across environments

## Alerts and Notifications

Set up alerts to stay informed about your workflow performance:

### Execution Alerts

Configure notifications for execution events:

- Flow start and completion
- Execution failures
- Long-running executions
- Custom condition triggers

### System Notifications

Receive updates about system-level events:

- Schedule changes
- Version updates
- Maintenance notices
- Resource usage warnings

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Flow Not Triggering

If your flow isn't triggering as expected:

1. Check if the flow is activated
2. Verify the trigger configuration
3. Look for error messages in the execution logs
4. Ensure any external triggers are sending data correctly

### Slow Execution

If your flow is running slowly:

1. Identify bottleneck nodes using duration metrics
2. Check for unnecessary operations
3. Optimize data processing steps
4. Consider refactoring complex flows into multiple simpler flows

### High Error Rates

If your flow has a high error rate:

1. Review execution logs to identify patterns
2. Check external service dependencies
3. Implement more robust error handling
4. Validate input data earlier in the flow

## Best Practices

- **Regular Audits**: Periodically review all active flows for relevance and performance
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation about each flow's purpose and operation
- **Testing**: Test flows thoroughly after any changes
- **Incremental Changes**: Make small, incremental changes rather than large overhauls
- **Consistent Naming**: Use a consistent naming convention for flows and nodes
- **Clean Up**: Remove or archive obsolete flows to maintain a clean workspace

## Advanced Monitoring

### Custom Dashboards

Create custom dashboards for monitoring specific metrics:

1. Define the metrics you want to track
2. Configure visualization preferences
3. Set up refresh intervals
4. Share dashboards with team members

### Logging Integration

Integrate with external logging systems:

- Send execution logs to centralized logging platforms
- Configure log detail levels
- Implement structured logging for better analysis
- Set up log retention policies
