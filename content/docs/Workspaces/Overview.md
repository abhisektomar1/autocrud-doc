A workspace in AutoCRUD is your dedicated environment for managing databases, views, and team collaborations. Think of it as your project's home base where you can:

- Organize multiple databases and their connections
- Create and manage different views of your data
- Control access permissions for team members
- Monitor workspace activity and usage

## Key Features

### Central Management

- Single dashboard to manage all your database connections
- Overview of all active views and collaborators
- Usage statistics and activity logs

### Security

- Role-based access control
- Secure database credential management
- Audit trails for all workspace activities

### Organization

- Logical grouping of related databases and views
- Easy navigation between different projects
- Customizable workspace settings

## Getting Started

To make the most of your workspace:

1. Configure your workspace settings
2. Connect your first database
3. Invite team members
4. Create your first view
