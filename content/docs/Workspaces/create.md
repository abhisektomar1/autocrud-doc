# Creating a Workspace

Workspaces in AutoCRUD are the foundation for organizing your data and automations. This guide walks you through creating your first workspace.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of what you want to accomplish with your workspace

## Step 1: Access the Workspace Creation Screen

1. Log in to your AutoCRUD account
2. On the homepage, click the **Create Workspace** button
3. Alternatively, you can click the dropdown menu in the top navigation and select "Create Workspace"

3. Click **Create Workspace** to confirm

### Naming Best Practices

Choose workspace names that:

- Clearly indicate the purpose or project
- Are concise but descriptive
- Follow a consistent naming convention
- Avoid special characters that might cause issues

**Examples of good workspace names:**

- Marketing Campaigns 2023
- Customer Support Database
- Product Development
- Finance Department

## Step 3: Configure Your New Workspace

Once your workspace is created, you'll be directed to the workspace dashboard where you can:

1. Start adding tables to store your data
2. Create flows to automate processes
3. Configure workspace settings
4. Invite team members to collaborate

1. Navigate to the **Settings** section in the left sidebar
2. Configure:
   - Appearance settings
   - Default permissions

3. Save your changes

## Step 5: Invite Team Members (Optional)

3. Click **Invite Members**
4. Enter email addresses and set permission levels
5. Send invitations

## Workspace Limitations

Keep in mind the following limitations for workspaces:

| Feature               | Free Plan | Pro Plan  | Enterprise Plan |
| --------------------- | --------- | --------- | --------------- |
| Workspaces            | 1         | Unlimited | Unlimited       |
| Members per workspace | 3         | 10        | Unlimited       |
| Storage               | 1GB       | 10GB      | 100GB+          |
| Tables per workspace  | 10        | 50        | Unlimited       |
| Flows per workspace   | 5         | 20        | Unlimited       |

## Best Practices

- **One Workspace Per Project**: Create separate workspaces for distinct projects or departments
- **Clear Structure**: Plan your workspace organization before adding many tables or flows
- **Documentation**: Add descriptions to help team members understand the workspace purpose
- **Regular Cleanup**: Archive or delete unused elements to maintain a clean workspace
- **Permission Management**: Regularly review and update member permissions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues When Creating Workspaces

**Issue**: Workspace name already exists
**Solution**: Choose a different, unique name for your workspace

**Issue**: Cannot create additional workspaces
**Solution**: Check your subscription limits or upgrade your plan

**Issue**: Workspace creation fails
**Solution**: Try clearing your browser cache or using a different browser
