## Creating a Custom Theme

2. This will revert all custom color settings to their defaults
3. You'll need to save the theme after resetting

## Theme Management

### Sharing Themes

Currently, themes are specific to your user account and apply to all workspaces you access. Team members will need to set their own theme preferences.

### Theme Persistence

Your theme selection is remembered across sessions. When you log out and log back in, your chosen theme will still be applied.

## Best Practices

- **Brand Consistency**: For business workspaces, consider using colors that match your company's brand
- **Readability**: Ensure there's enough contrast between text and background colors
- **User Preference**: Remember that themes are user-specific, so each team member can select their preferred theme
- **Testing**: Test custom themes on different screens to ensure they look good on various devices

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Custom colors not saving
**Solution**: Ensure you click the "Save Theme" button after making changes

**Issue**: Difficulty seeing text after changing colors
**Solution**: Aim for high contrast between text and background colors

**Issue**: Theme appears inconsistent across pages
**Solution**: Refresh the browser or try clearing your cache
